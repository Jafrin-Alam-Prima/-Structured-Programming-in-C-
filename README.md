# ðŸ“Œ Structured Programming in C  

This repository contains all the C programs I wrote during my **1st semester (2022)** while learning **Structured Programming in C**.  
It covers fundamental concepts such as **loops, arrays, functions, file handling, pattern printing, sorting algorithms, and even a music program! ðŸŽµ**

## ðŸŽ¶ Music Program - It generate music. 

One of the most exciting programs in this repository is `music.c`, which **Recreate an interesting tune** from the Bollywood movie *Koi Mil Gaya (2003)*.  
It uses the **Beep()** function to generate musical frequencies.  

### ðŸŽ§ Code for `music.c`  
```c
#include <windows.h>

int main() {
    Beep(493.9, 500);
    Beep(523.3, 500);
    Beep(698.5, 500);
    Beep(659.3, 800);
    Beep(493.9, 500);
    Beep(523.3, 500);
    Beep(659.3, 500);
    Beep(587.3, 800);
    Beep(493.9, 500);
    Beep(523.3, 500);
    Beep(698.5, 1000);
    Beep(659.3, 500);
    Beep(587.3, 500);
    Beep(659.3, 1000);
    return 0;
}
